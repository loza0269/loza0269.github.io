I am 19 years old, from Ronkonkoma, Long Island. I grew up on\r\nLong Island my entire life and have always lived in the same house in the same neighborhood.\r\n\r\n### Why Computer Science?\r\nAlthough i am deeply passionate about Computer Science, i was not always like that. I never really realized i was always deeply intrigued by computers. Growing up i was always a math and science kid and seriously loved problem solving. During my adolescent years while playing videos games i started to become more intrigued in hacking in to the files and cheating my way through the game, then actually playing the game. Many people thought this was because i was to lazy to play the game. At first i kinda thought that was the reason too. As i got better at doing it, i realized that i just enjoyed learning how the files could be altered and how these files generally worked.Although i did enjoy the benefits of hacking through these games, the real thrill was figuring out how to do it in the first place.\r\n\r\n### What i would like to do with my degree\r\nBecause Computer Science can be so vague there are many positions i would be more then happy to take on and prove where i am as a programmer. My biggest ambition is to be a software designer, working with a team to problem solve various different solutions to a single problem and finding the most efficient way out of it. I have great people skills and enjoy working in medium to small groups of people where all input can be heard to make solutions more efficient and to challenge fellow team members to be the best they can be.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nThank you so very much for taking the time to read this and to hear a general story about who i am and who i strive to be. If you have any questions or would like to speak with me please contact me at 631-672-8400.\",",
